  title: "Understanding EJS: Why I Use It Before React",
  category: "Frontend",
  date: "Aug 29, 2025",
  content: `Everyone is rushing to React, but I think there's still a powerful place for EJS in your workflow â€” especially if you're learning full-stack development.

In this post, I break down what EJS actually does, why it helps you grasp templating and dynamic rendering, and how it fits into the Node.js ecosystem. I show examples of how to pass variables, loop over data, and structure partials (like headers/footers). 

Weâ€™ll also talk about EJSâ€™s sweet spot â€” small-to-mid sized apps, dashboards, and SSR prototypes â€” and why mastering it helped me debug React apps better later.`,

  category: "Backend",
  date: "Aug 28, 2025",
  content: `Routing in Express can feel confusing when you're new. Do you use app.get? What about req.params vs req.query? And where do you put your logic?

In this post, I simplify Express routing by comparing it to real-world paths â€” like walking through folders. You'll learn about dynamic routes (posts.slug), RESTful endpoints, middleware chaining, and how to split your routes into separate files.

Bonus: I include a complete mini Express app you can clone and learn from.`,

  category: "JavaScript",
  date: "Aug 27, 2025",
  content: `Closures confused me more than any other JavaScript concept â€” until I compared them to sandwiches. Weird, I know.

In this tutorial, I walk you through what a closure is, when you use it (like in event handlers or async code), and why it matters for scope and memory.

Youâ€™ll build a closure-powered counter, see how to preserve state between function calls, and learn why this concept is critical for React hooks like useState. Plus, youâ€™ll never look at sandwiches the same again.`,

  category: "Backend",

  content: `APIs aren't scary â€” they're just structured conversations between machines.

In this post, we build a simple REST API with Express and break down the five core HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) in real-world terms. You'll learn the difference between parameters and query strings, and how to test endpoints using Postman.

By the end, you'll be hitting routes like /api/posts/:id with swagger. Bonus: I show you how to write your own middleware to log every request.`,

This post walks you through how async and await changed the game for writing readable asynchronous code. You'll learn how promises work under the hood, and how to rewrite old-school XHR or fetch() logic with elegant async syntax.

Plus, I give you 3 common async bugs I made as a beginner â€” and how to avoid them.`,

In this hands-on tutorial, I walk you through **CSS Grid** â€” the most powerful layout tool in CSS. We'll build a real dashboard layout with multiple columns, nested grids, and responsive design â€” all without relying on floats or Bootstrap classes.

You'll leave this post knowing how to use grid-template-areas, auto-fit, fr units, and media queries that *actually work*. Plus, Iâ€™ll show you how I use Firefox DevTools to debug any layout fast.`,
